# noteTaker

## Description
In this project I use Express to build the backend for a note  taking web app. The app has four routes in total. The first route uses a 'GET' request to navigate to the page where users
can input their note with a title, the second uses a 'GET' request in the api path to return all notes in the "database" file in json form, third simply takes users to the landing page if they 
put in a path in the browser for which there is no route, and the last uses a 'POST' request to update the db file with new notes when the users click the save button on the front end.
I used a npm package called 'generate-unique-id' to give each note in the db file a unique identifier.
